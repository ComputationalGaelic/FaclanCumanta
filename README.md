# FaclanCumanta
Generating worksheets and exercises for practising Faclan Cumanta

These are a set of scripts for creating worksheets and exercises
to support learning the **Faclan Cumanta** (Common Words) taught 
in Gaelic Medium Education schools.

Where possible, the code has been written in Gaelic and therefore
requires a Unicode supporting environment.

The font used in the examples is **Sassoon Primary**. The Sassoon 
fonts are available from http://www.sassoonfont.co.uk/
